# Traffic Volume Data Analysis

This project analyzes traffic volume patterns using the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from real-world traffic data, such as identifying rush hours and understanding the effect of weather on traffic.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Metro Interstate Traffic Volume](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshxy/metro-interstate-traffic-volume)
- **Description**: Hourly traffic volume records collected from sensors on I-94 in Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul. The dataset includes traffic volume, weather conditions, and time-related features.

## Objectives

- Identify peak traffic hours and seasonal trends
- Analyze the impact of weather conditions on traffic flow
- Visualize trends using data plots, including:
  - Hourly traffic trend plots
  - Weather vs. traffic comparisons
  - Monthly/seasonal volume charts

## Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language for analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running Python code
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Key Visualizations

- **Hourly Traffic Trend**: A plot of hourly traffic volume patterns.
- **Weather vs. Traffic**: A comparison of weather conditions with traffic volume.
- **Monthly/Seasonal Traffic Volume**: Trends based on months or seasons.

## How to View

You can view and interact with the project in two ways:

1. **Open the `.html` file in any browser** (no setup required):
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the output and visualizations generated by the project.

2. **Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook** for full interactivity:
   - Run the following command in your terminal to start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface for a more interactive experience. You can run each cell, modify code, and visualize the results in real-time.
